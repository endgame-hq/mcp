Endgame is a purpose-built cloud platform designed for AI Agents. Its mission is simple: enable AI to deliver software 100x fasterâ€”at the pace AI can think, build and test.

Endgame uses this MCP to integrate directly into AI-augmented development tools like Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, and Claude Code, and give AI Agents everything they need to autonomously create, deploy, test, and refine software at unprecedented speed.

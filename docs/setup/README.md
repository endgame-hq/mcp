Endgame prioritizes its [Model Context Protocol Server (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for a streamlined experience, over traditional cloud tools like CLIs, SDKs, or dashboards.

The MCP is a code library that encapsulates logic and API calls into a suite of AI-optimized tools, enabling autonomous operations on your behalf.

The MCP integrates seamlessly with these tools: Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, and VS Code. There isn't a way to use Endgame outside of these tools. Choose your preferred tool to proceed.

## API Key Setup

An API Key is required for the MCP to authenticate and manage actions on your Endgame account, such as deploying applications.

To obtain an API Key:

1. Sign up for an account on the [Endgame Dashboard](https://dashboard.endgame.dev).
2. Upon account creation, an API Key is automatically generated. Access it via:
    * The dashboard's initial setup guide, which provides tool-specific configuration guides with your API Key pre-embedded. Copy the configuration to set up your tool.
    * The [Settings](https://dashboard.endgame.dev/settings) tab in the Dashboard, where your API Key is displayed.

**Security Note:** Your API Key is linked to your personal account. Treat it like a passwordâ€”do not share or expose it publicly. It enables your AI tools to act on your behalf, automating tasks within your Endgame account.
